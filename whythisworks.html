              <p class="short-desc">Since the start of digitalisation, 
                many aspects of daily life has been replaced or supported by 
                digital tools, such as communication, financial transactions, 
                and researching. It has become a natural part of our lives, 
                and we believe that children should learn how to use it. </p>

<!--<br><br>It is recognized that the level of the students' engagement in the classroom has a significant part of their education as it improves their academic performance. The research has shown that the teacher has influence on students' motivation through factors such as their teaching methods and content. An engaged teacher usually searches for new ideas, accommodates material to their students' needs, monitors their progress, etc. It is recommended that the educator uses an Engagement measurement/reflection tool.-->
