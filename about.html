            <p>The research was formed in collaboration with our project partner - HackShield. They have developed an educational game for children to learn about cybersecurity and introduced us to the topic of gamification, which led us to studying the use of innovative digital teaching techniques. By conducting a literature review, a focus group with teachers and educational experts, and A/B testing, we have come up with this intervention. </p>

<!--<br><br>It is recognized that the level of the students' engagement in the classroom has a significant part of their education as it improves their academic performance. The research has shown that the teacher has influence on students' motivation through factors such as their teaching methods and content. An engaged teacher usually searches for new ideas, accommodates material to their students' needs, monitors their progress, etc. It is recommended that the educator uses an Engagement measurement/reflection tool.-->
