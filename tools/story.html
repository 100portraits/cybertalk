            <p class="short-desc">Storytelling can help teachers convey information and connect with their students on a personal level. By using stories, complex topics can be made more relatable and understandable to students. Students can also create their own stories, which fosters creativity and imagination. They can help to improve communication and public speaking skills, as students learn to express themselves effectively and engage their audience..
