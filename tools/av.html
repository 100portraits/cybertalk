            <p class="short-desc">Audiovisual tools are a powerful way for teachers to create engaging and interactive learning experiences for their students. By incorporating videos, animations, and other multimedia elements into their lessons, teachers can help students visualise the studied concept. 
<br><br>
                Use of audiovisual tools can also help to improve student engagement and retention, as students are more likely to remember information that they have seen and heard in action. Additionally, it can be used to promote creativity and critical thinking skills, as students are encouraged to think about how to effectively communicate ideas through different media.
