                Digital polling is a versatile and effective educational technique that allows teachers to collect instant feedback from their students. It allows teachers to quickly assess student comprehension or gain their opinions during a brainstorm.
<br><br>
Similarly to other techniques, digital polling can promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as students are required to analyse information and make informed decisions. Digital polling can also be used to promote collaboration and teamwork, as students can work together to answer questions and solve problems.
